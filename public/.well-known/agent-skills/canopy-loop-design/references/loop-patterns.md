# Loop Patterns

Reusable graph patterns for Canopy loops.

---

## 1. Feature Delivery Loop

Use when implementing a new feature with review and verification.

```text
implementer --always--> verifier --pass--> reviewer --pass--> finish_gate
                              \--fail-----------------------> implementer
reviewer --fail---------------------------------------------> implementer
finish_gate(pass_route=next_spec)
```

Best for:

- feature work
- larger refactors
- multi-step backend/frontend changes

---

## 2. Focused Bugfix Loop

Use when the loop has a strong deterministic check.

```text
fixer --always--> targeted_test --pass--> finish_gate
                         \--fail--------> fixer
finish_gate(pass_route=next_spec)
```

Best for:

- regressions
- failing test repairs
- crash fixes

---

## 3. Review-Driven Authoring

Use when quality of reasoning matters more than a shell check.

```text
author --always--> reviewer --pass--> approval_gate
                      \--fail--------> author
approval_gate(pass_route=next_spec, fail_route=author)
```

Best for:

- docs
- prompts
- architecture proposals
- migrations needing explicit approval language

---

## 4. External Intake to Internal Execution

Use when a first node extracts or discovers tasks.

```text
extractor --pass--> planner --pass--> implementer --always--> verifier
                                           ^                    |
                                           |-------fail---------|
```

Best for:

- reading tasks from issue trackers
- processing backlog files
- consuming MCP-fed work queues

---

## 5. Multi-Platform Cross-Check

Use when you want a second CLI/model family to catch what the first one missed, instead of a same-vendor reviewer marking its own work.

```text
implementer(claude/opus) --always--> crosscheck(opencode/qwen) --pass--> finish_gate
                                            \--fail-------------------> implementer(claude/opus)
finish_gate(pass_route=next_spec) --fail--> implementer(codex)
```

- `implementer` — `agent` node on one platform/model (e.g. `platform: "anthropic", model: "claude-sonnet-5"`).
- `crosscheck` — `check`/`agent` node on a **different** platform (e.g. `platform: "opencode", model: "qwen3-coder"`), reviewing the implementer's diff against the spec.
- `finish_gate` — routes on the cross-check verdict; on repeated failure, escalate to a third platform (e.g. `platform: "codex"`) rather than looping the same pair forever.

Best for:

- security-sensitive changes where a same-vendor blind spot is a real risk
- verifying that a fix isn't overfit to one model's interpretation of the spec
- setups where the user has multiple CLI subscriptions and wants them cross-validating each other

Rules:

- never assume the cross-check platform matches the implementer's — that defeats the purpose
- keep the cross-check prompt narrow (diff + spec + "find what's wrong"), not a re-implementation
- cap escalation depth (e.g. 1 cross-check retry, then 1 third-platform escalation) so the loop can't spin forever between two disagreeing models

---

## 6. Commit-on-Green Finish

Use only when the user explicitly allows commits inside the loop.

```text
implementer -> verifier -> reviewer -> commit_ready_gate
commit_ready_gate(pass)-> committer -> next_spec
commit_ready_gate(fail)-> implementer
```

Rules:

- commit node must not run before verification
- commit prompts should include commit policy and checkpoint expectations
- if commits are not allowed, replace `committer` with a summary/report node

---

## 7. Gated Implement (deterministic check before review)

The default shape for "an agent writes code, something must verify it, then it
lands". Three nodes, four edges.

```text
implement --pass--> check(build+tests) --pass--> review+commit
    ^                    |fail                        |fail
    +--------------------+<---------------------------+

implement --fail--> (no edge)   => spec fails honestly (e.g. CLI quota)
review    --pass--> (no edge)   => spec completed, advance
```

| from | cond | to |
|---|---|---|
| implement | `pass` | check |
| check | `pass` | review |
| check | `fail` | implement |
| review | `fail` | implement |

Why each piece:

- **`implement --pass-->`, never `always`.** An `always` edge routes a *failed*
  implement into the reviewer, which then approves work that was never written. A
  real run marked a spec `completed` with no commit behind it that way.
- **`check` sits before the reviewer**, so code that does not build or whose tests
  are red never reaches review. Another real run: the reviewer wrote
  `CHANGES_NEEDED: Implementation is broken` and the spec was still marked
  `completed`, because routing keyed on the run's status, not on the prose.
- **Auto-fixing commands should not bounce work.** Run `cargo fmt --all` (which
  rewrites) rather than `cargo fmt -- --check` (which fails). Only genuine
  breakage — compiler, linter, tests — should route back to `implement`.
- **The reviewer commits only the files it reviewed.** `git add -A` sweeps a
  previous spec's uncommitted leftovers into this spec's commit.
- **Make the reviewer prove the commit.** Its prompt must require
  `git log -1 --oneline` before reporting pass. A reviewer once returned
  `{"committed": true, "tests_passed": 601}` for a commit that did not exist.

### Reviewer prompt discipline

Once `check` runs before the reviewer, green gates say only *"nothing is broken"* —
they say nothing about whether the spec was **honored**. That distinction is the
reviewer's entire job, and it is the thing a cheap model quietly skips. Say so
explicitly:

- Open with a **zero-indulgence** instruction: do not approve out of courtesy, for
  effort spent, or because it "almost" meets the spec.
- State that **green gates are not evidence of compliance**. A missing required
  test is `CHANGES_NEEDED` even when the code works perfectly.
- Require a **verdict per requirement**, written out *before* the decision. A
  reviewer that must enumerate is a reviewer that must look.
- Make the asymmetry explicit: *"when in doubt, CHANGES_NEEDED — a bounce costs
  minutes, a falsely-closed spec costs days."*
- Tell it what its unique contribution is: the deterministic nodes already own
  "compiles", "tests pass" and "commit exists". **Judgment is all it adds.**

Observed limit: with a small/fast reviewer model this raises the floor but does not
guarantee it. In one real run the spec demanded three tests, the prompt said
"verify the three tests", and a free `flash` model approved a diff carrying one.
The deterministic nodes still held — nothing broken merged — but scope compliance
slipped. Budget for that when picking the reviewer's model, or accept the gap
knowingly.

Trade-off: the reviewer's honesty is still load-bearing for the **commit** itself.
Close that with a fourth node, `review --pass--> check_committed`, routing back to
`implement` on failure. Verify by **comparing `HEAD`**, not by matching the commit
message (the agent may drop the conventional-commit scope) and not by wall-clock
(the previous spec's commit is recent too). Have the gates check record `HEAD` as
its last step:

```bash
<your build+test gates> && git rev-parse HEAD > .git/canopy-prev-head
```

and let `check_committed` require that it moved and the tree is clean:

```bash
test -f .git/canopy-prev-head \
  && test -z "$(git status --porcelain -- src/)" \
  && test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$(cat .git/canopy-prev-head)"
```

The `test -f` matters: without it a missing file makes `$(cat …)` empty, the
comparison reads as "changed", and the check passes for a commit that never
happened. Keep the marker inside `.git/` so it never dirties `git status`.

Restart caveat: the marker file survives daemon/PC restarts pointing at a stale
HEAD, which can turn into a false positive if the flow resumes past the gates
node. Delete the marker in pre-flight and only resume at (or before) the gates
node that rewrites it.

---

## 8. Resilience Branch (triage a failed implement)

Pattern 7 fails the spec the moment `implement` dies, so **nobody ever reads the
failure**. If the CLI died on a quota that resets at a known hour, that knowledge
is thrown away. Give `implement` two exits.

```text
implement --pass--> check --pass--> review+commit
    |                  |fail             |fail
    |fail              v                 v
    v               implement <----------+
resilience
    --pass--> implement     (fixed it -> retry)
    --fail--> (no edge)     (spec fails, but the autorun is already scheduled)
```

The `resilience` node (cheap model, short timeout) reads the failed implement's
output and:

1. repairs transient failures (bad command, missing dep) and reports **pass**, so
   the implement retries;
2. on quota exhaustion (`"You've hit your session limit · resets <time>"`), parses
   the time, calls `loop_schedule_autorun { loop_id, at }`, then reports **fail** —
   the spec fails, but the loop wakes itself at exactly that moment;
3. **cleans the worktree if the dead implement left it dirty.** A quota death can
   land mid-edit; the next attempt would otherwise start on a dirty tree.

Rules:

- `implement`'s `pass` and `fail` conditions are disjoint, so this adds no
  ambiguity. Every node ends up with an incoming edge, so make `implement`
  `position: 1` — the engine falls back to the lowest position when no source node
  exists.
- Keep `resilience` on a different platform/quota than `implement`, or it will be
  dead exactly when you need it.
- Cap it: a `resilience -> implement -> resilience` cycle is bounded by the
  per-node iteration budget, but a resilience node that always reports pass will
  burn all ten attempts.
- **Give the resilience node the clock.** Models do not know the current time, and
  "resets 6am" is ambiguous without it. A real run at 01:52 scheduled the autorun
  for 6am **of the next day** — a 23-hour stall. The prompt must require running
  `date -Iseconds` first, computing the next instant strictly after now, and
  sanity-checking that the result is less than 24 h away.

---

## Failure modes (field notes)

Real breakages seen running these patterns at scale. The engine is strict about
graph shape and fails hard, so validate before `loop_run` (checklist in
`SKILL.md` → "Graph Validation").

### The `implement <-> review` cycle has no entry node

The most natural retry shape — `implement --always--> review` plus
`review --fail--> implement` — is a **cycle where every node has an incoming
edge**. The engine resolves a spec's start node as the one with no incoming edge,
so this shape historically failed *instantly* with `"Spec has no entry node"`:
loop `failed`, zero runs, `started_at == completed_at`. The engine now falls back
to the **lowest-`position`** node, so set the intended start to `position: 1` and
treat `position` as load-bearing. Don't depend on node insertion order.

### Duplicate outgoing edges → `"ambiguous outgoing edges"`

If two edges leave the same node, both match a result, and they point at
**different targets**, edge selection aborts and fails the whole loop — *after* the
node's work is done, so it's easy to miss in review. Byte-identical duplicates
(same target and condition) are now deduped instead of fatal, but still dedupe by
`(from_node, condition)` before calling `loop_add_edge`. A `pass` edge and a `fail`
edge from the same node are fine.

### Node `config` sent as a JSON-encoded string

The MCP schema for `loop_add_node`/`loop_update_node` once declared `config` as an
untyped value, so clients serialized it to a *string*. The node stored fine and
then died mid-run with `"missing a platform/cli"`. The schema now declares
`"type": "object"` and serde rejects non-objects at parse time — but if you build
nodes by any other route (direct SQL), verify the stored config is an object.

### Agent CLI not resolvable by the daemon

Nodes spawn their CLI from the **daemon's** environment, not your shell. A binary
on your `$PATH` but not the daemon's fails to spawn mid-run — under systemd the
service PATH is minimal and may be a stale hand-written snapshot. Use an absolute
`binary` in `~/.canopy/config.toml` (re-read per node, no daemon restart needed)
or put its dir on the daemon's PATH. Beware: reinstalling the service rewrites
the unit file and can silently drop a hand-added PATH line.

### Agent quota / session limit mid-loop

A long multi-spec loop can outrun a CLI's session/usage quota. The agent node exits
non-zero with *"You've hit your session limit · resets &lt;time&gt;"* in its `stdout`.

- **Big spec → long run → burnt quota.** This is the real reason to keep specs
  small. It is not a graph bug.
- **Completed specs are skipped on relaunch**, so recovery is cheap: reset the loop
  (and the stalled spec) status and `loop_run` again; it resumes at the first
  non-completed spec.
- **Don't poll with a recurring cron.** Use pattern 8: a resilience node parses the
  reset time and calls `loop_schedule_autorun { loop_id, at }`, which wakes the
  scheduler exactly once at that instant. A blind cron retry wastes attempts
  against the per-node iteration budget.
- Spreading implement and review across different platforms (pattern 5) means one
  quota ceiling doesn't stall everything.

### A quota death can leave a dirty worktree

The CLI may work for many minutes, write a dozen files, *then* hit its limit and
exit non-zero. The spec fails with uncommitted, half-finished work on disk, and the
next attempt starts from there. Rule of thumb: if the partial work **compiles**,
keep it (the implement completes it); if it **doesn't**, discard it. Back it up
either way with `git stash create` + `git stash store`, which does not touch the
worktree.

### A daemon restart orphans the running loop

The loop row stays `running` with no process behind it. Scheduled autoruns cannot
rescue it (`is_fireable()` excludes `Running`). Recover with `loop_pause` →
`loop_continue(retry_current_node)`; the spec's own `running` status makes the
engine resume at its last node, so nothing is re-implemented. See the Recovery
Matrix in `mcp-tool-playbook.md`.
